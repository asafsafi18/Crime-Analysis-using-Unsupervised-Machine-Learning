# Crime-Analysis-using-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning
When we need to visit a city or want to go to a particular location or move to live in a specific place, we must have prior knowledge of the intended places, such as the level of safety, especially if we are unfamiliar with those areas. Therefore, crime analysis is a technical method that can benefit us in that. It can identify criminal patterns and trends, and thus we would be aware of the level of safety in those places we want to visit. So dividing the city zones into some clusters similar to each other in terms of safety level could help avoid some of the risks and crimes that could be occurring in our society.
